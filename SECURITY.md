## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1.  **Do NOT create a public issue.**
2.  Email `security@voxlabs.ai` (or the maintainer).
3.  Include a proof of concept if possible.
4.  We will respond within 48 hours.

## Voice Cloning Ethics & Safety

VoxLabs is designed with safeguards:
- **Consent Verification**: The API requires a signed consent token (simulated in v2.0).
- **Watermarking**: Generated audio contains inaudible watermarks identifying it as AI-generated.
